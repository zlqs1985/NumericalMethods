We only observe data on choices, i.e. how much was consumed, at which price of the good. We will specify an economic model, and estimate the value of the preference parameter.\n",

    "of $\\beta$ will be a parameter vector that satisfies FOC\n",
    "and at the same time minimizes some criterion function.\n",

However, every choice of $\\beta$ needs to go together with a corresponding choice of $\\epsilon$'s which need to be chosen s.t. the constraint is satisfied. This is not a general feature of MPEC, as in many cases the parameters of interest would appear in the objective. Also, in a more elaborate model, we would probably have some data that we would want to model to come close to; In that case our objective function would be augmented by the likelihood function of that data together with our model, or we could have a moment criterion etc.\n",
